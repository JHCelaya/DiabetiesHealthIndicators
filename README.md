# DiabetiesHealthIndicators
Project for data science class. Exploratory data analysis, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbor + cross validation for optimization.

We are conducting a study to explore the relationship between lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity, and diet) and the prevalence of Diabetes Type 2. It is already well known that lifestyle factors are linked to this chronic disease but we wanted to know which factor would have the strongest influence. We also wanted to know if, based on these factors, we could predict its occurrence. If we were able to successfully predict it, then prevention and intervention could be instilled earlier which would in effect reduce its cost. In addition peopleâ€™s everyday lives would also be improved as some of the symptoms include fatigue, numbness/tingling, frequent infections among other things. To look into this we used a dataset released by the CDC from 2015. It had more than enough participants and a large number of variables too. We started by plotting the variables selected and then used a heatmap to observe correlations. To understand how predictive each of our factors were we used the KNN model (K-Nearest Neighbors). We increased our observations to see if that would increase our accuracy but were not successful. Although we were not able to confidently predict Type 2 Diabetes, our analysis shows that there is a correlation between our selected variables and its prevalence.
